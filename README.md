## Project Summary/Abstract  
### This project focuses on deploying an intelligent in-network attack detection system powered by machine learning to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses. The system will be evaluated for performance in terms of latency and throughput to ensure minimal impact on network efficiency. Deployment and validation will be conducted on a real-world testbed, such as the USC datacenter or the FABRIC national testbed, to demonstrate scalability and practical effectiveness.
