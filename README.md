## Project Summary/Abstract  
### This project focuses on deploying an intelligent in-network attack detection system powered by machine learning to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses. The system will be evaluated for performance in terms of latency and throughput to ensure minimal impact on network efficiency. Deployment and validation will be conducted on a real-world testbed, such as the USC datacenter or the FABRIC national testbed, to demonstrate scalability and practical effectiveness. 

## Problem Description  
- Problem description: As network speeds continue to increase and cyberattacks grow in sophistication, traditional defense mechanisms struggle to keep pace. Conventional approaches often cannot efficiently inspect the massive volumes of traffic, much of which is encrypted, without introducing significant performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, distributed architectures and hardware-accelerated solutions are emerging as promising alternatives for scalable and effective network defense.
  
- Motivation  
  - The rapid growth of network traffic and encrypted communication requires scalable, intelligent security mechanisms that can operate in real time.  
  - Traditional centralized intrusion detection systems cannot handle the volume and speed of modern data flows without causing performance degradation.  
  - Deploying machine learning–based, in-network detection systems on real testbeds (e.g., USC datacenter, FABRIC) provides a practical path to evaluate and advance next-generation cybersecurity solutions.  
- Challenges  
  - Designing ML models that can accurately detect evolving attack patterns while maintaining low false positives in high-speed environments.  
  - Ensuring system performance by minimizing added latency and maintaining high throughput during live deployment.  
  - Integrating the system into real-world testbeds with heterogeneous infrastructure and validating scalability under realistic traffic conditions. 
 
## Contribution  
### [`Novel contribution`]
